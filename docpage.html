          Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, but can grow to more than 30 feet (9 meters) high. 
          Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing opposite each other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow along the branches. 
          Because it grows in a continuous cycle, it’s not unusual to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes nearly a year for a cherry to mature after first flowering, and about 5 years of growth to reach full fruit production. 
          While coffee plants can live up to 100 years, they are generally the most productive between the ages of 7 and 20. 
          Proper care can maintain and even increase their output over the years, depending on the variety. 
          The average coffee tree produces 10 pounds of coffee cherry per year, or 2 pounds of green beans.

          Great coffee starts with great beans. The quality and flavor of your coffee is not only determined by your favorite brewing process, but also by the type of coffee you select. 
          There can be a world of difference between roasts.
          Some of the flavor factors include:
          <ul>
            <li>The country and region of origin</li>
            <li>The variety of bean - arabica, robusta - or a blend</li>
            <li>The roast type</li>
            <li>The texture of your grind</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            if (variety.isArabica){
              return grind();
            }
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          While there are a lot of choices, remember that there’s no right or wrong — for instance, you can choose a dark, flavorful espresso roast coffee and still have it ground to be brewed in a drip system. 
          Have fun trying and enjoying different combinations.

          Here are a few tips to make a perfect coffee:
          <ul>
            <li>The grind: If you buy whole bean coffee, always grind your beans as close to the brew time as possible for maximum freshness. 
            A burr or mill grinder is best because the coffee is ground to a consistent size. </li>
            <li>The water: The water you use is very important to the quality of your coffee. 
              Use filtered or bottled water if your tap water is not good or has a strong odor or taste, such as chlorine.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of time that the water is in contact with the coffee grounds is another important flavor factor.
          In a drip system, the contact time should be approximately 5 minutes. If you are making your coffee using a French Press, the contact time should be 2-4 minutes. 
          Espresso has an especially brief brew time — the coffee is in contact with the water for only 20-30 seconds. 
          Cold brew, on the other hand, should steep overnight (about 12 hours). 
        </p>

            while (time < 5){
              brew();
            }

          Prepared coffee begins to lose its optimal taste moments after brewing, so only make as much coffee as you’ll drink. 
          Otherwise, coffee can be poured into a warmed, insulated thermos to be consumed within an hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to enjoy your coffee as thoughtfully as it was prepared - take in the aroma, and notice the flavors in each sip. 
          Many people have been instrumental in bringing it to your cup.
